# What's goin' on here?

If you're here, you're interested in some part of me.  So, off the bat, I offer you a welcome!  Come on in and check out what interests you.

Each repository that I present in my profile will showcase something I have worked on or am currently working on.  Each one will contain a README.md doc (like this one) describing what you will find in repository along with a "Why Did this Interest Me and What was I Hoping to Get Out of It?" section.  Finally, every other README.md doc (except for this one) will also contain various documents that I have created or in which I've participated.

## Why Did this Interest Me and What was I Hoping to Get Out of It?

I made a career out of engineering, data analysis and quality control.  I worked many years as a Six Sigma Black Belt for a major Telecom.  I found, and continue to find, Six Sigma/LEAN a wonderful approach to project management in relation to quality control via process improvement and waste mitigation.  

The area within Six Sigma/Lean that I found could be improved upon was an automated approach to data retrieval, analysis and visualization.  It's in this area that I focused on learning a new set of skills.  With minimal programing experience, I took Udacity's Data Analysis Nanodegree (DANd) with the intention of learning Python (and its suite of Data Analysis libraries, Pandas & Numpy) in order to automate my data retrieval and anlysis tasks.  I learned that and more, of course.

I then turned my attention to what wasn't addressed in Udcacity's DANd: SQL, R & Tableau.  I found those skills available to me through the Google Data Analytics Certificate and began a secondary study which makes it's place here, as well.

Life isn't just Data Analysis (thank goodness).  So, I roast, brew, drink and love coffee.  I pull my own shots on my vintage espresso machine.  I LOVE music.  I love creating sound and I love math (they go perfectly hand in hand together).  I also have a brand new bull terrier puppy named Willie.  I mountain bike the local trails around my house.  My guess is that all of these things, in some way, will make it on the pages here.  I know GIT is primarily for version control but sorry, my mind doesn't box things up that way.  Everything can be explored and plotted here, though Github.

Grab yourself a cup of coffee, stop by and noodle around.  Let me know if I can help you with anything.
