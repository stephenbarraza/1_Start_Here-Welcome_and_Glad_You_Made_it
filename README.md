# What's goin' on here.

If you're here, you're interested in some part of me.  So, off the bat, I offer you a welcome!  Come on in and check out what interests you.

Each repository will showcase something I worked on or am working on.  Each one will contain a README.md doc (like this one) describing what you will find in repository.  Each one (unlike this one) will also contain various documents that I have created or in which I've participated.

I made a career out of engineering, data analysis and quality control.  I roast, brew, drink and love coffee.  I pull my own shots on my vintage espresso machine.  I LOVE music.  I love creating sound and I love math.  They go perfectly hand in hand together.  I also have a brand new bull terrier puppy named Willie.  My guess is that all of these things, in some way, will make it on the pages here.  I know GIT is primarily for version control but sorry, my mind doesn't box things up that way.  Everything can be explored and plotted here.

Grab yourself a cup of coffee, stop by and noodle around.  Let me know if I can help you with anything.
